**This Python script** is designed to provide movie recommendations based on similarities between movies. It begins by preprocessing the movie dataset, merging relevant columns, handling missing values, and preparing text data for analysis by combining features like genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview into a new 'tagline' column. *Text data* is then converted into numerical vectors using **CountVectorizer**, with stemming applied to normalize words. Cosine similarity is calculated between movies based on their feature vectors, allowing for the determination of similarity scores for each pair of movies. The recommendation function takes a movie title as input, identifies the index of the movie in the dataset, retrieves similarity scores with other movies, sorts them based on similarity, and selects the top recommendations, which are then printed. The script demonstrates a content-based recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on textual features, offering a practical application of natural language processing techniques in movie recommendation.
